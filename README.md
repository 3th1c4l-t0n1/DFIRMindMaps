# DFIRMindMaps

This is a repository to centralize DFIR-related Mind Maps created with any Mind Mapping suites. Ideally, if you contribute to this repo, please provide the source file so others can import into their tool of choice so they can modify, improve, or repurpose your Mind Map as they see fit! I personally use [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) as I like how it has a Desktop application rather then being fully web-based like [MindMeister](https://www.mindmeister.com), which is a good tool in its own right.
