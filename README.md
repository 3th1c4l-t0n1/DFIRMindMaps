# DFIRMindMaps

This is a repository to centralize DFIR-related Mind Maps created with any Mind Mapping suites. Ideally, if you contribute to this repo, please provide the source file so others can import into their tool of choice so they can modify, improve, or repurpose your Mind Map as they see fit! I personally use [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) as I like how it has a Desktop application rather then being fully web-based like [MindMeister](https://www.mindmeister.com), which is a good tool in its own right. 

## Roadmap

I'm studying for the GCIH right now, so I need motivation to create visual learning aids for myself. If I create them, they will end up here in PNG and `.xmind` format. 

## TODO

1. add PR template
2. add more guidelines for contributions in README
